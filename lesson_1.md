## Drawing of a computer
![computer_drawing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89051396/130710781-2028c54d-8a1f-4a80-b30f-85b016b6f344.jpg)
On the outside I drew the very basic components of a computer (Case, monitor, mouse and keyboard)

On the inside I drew basic components of the motherboard which is the base for the rest of the components like the CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.

I drew the CPU Socket and its power connector, the 24 pin Motherboard power connector, DDR Slots for RAM, PCIe slot, SATA connectors for storage devices, CMOS battery, BIOS Chip(s) and I/O Shield.
