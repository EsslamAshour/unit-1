# 4. Morning jog
As a future athlete you just started your practice for an upcoming event. Given that on the first day you run x miles, and by the event you must be able to run y miles. Calculate the number of days required for you to finally reach the required distance for the event, if you increases your distance each day by 10% from the previous day.

# 5. The length of a sequence 
Given a sequence of non-negative integers, where each number is written in a separate line. Determine the length of the sequence, where the sequence ends when the integer is equal to 0. Print the length of the sequence (not counting the integer 0). The numbers following the number 0 should be omitted.
