# Lesson 1 (tiny) homework

## What is a variable?
A variable is a reversed location in memory that can hold a value.
In more simpler terms, it's a container that can hold a data type.

## What are the types of variables in Python?
The basic Python variable types (data types and structures) are:
  - Strings
  - Numbers (`int`, `float`, `complex`)
  - Lists
  - Tuples 
  - Dictionaries
  - Sets
  - Boolean

## What are the four computational thinking skills?
1. __Decomposition__ - breaking the problem down into smaller problems.
2. __Pattern recognition__ - relating the problem to previously solved similar problems.
3. __Abstraction__ - focusing only on the important parts of the problem.
4. __Algorithmic thinking__ - creating a set of procedures required (that anyone/computers can use) to solve the problem.
